                    <p class="card-text">Born and raised in Chicago, I have walked many miles in many shoes. 
                        I have worked in multiple industries including retail, sales, military service, computer repair, construction, and most recently; emergency medicine.
                        I have decided to change careers into programming as it's been an out of reach dream for me for the majority of my still short life.
                        Ambitious and educationally unchained, I plan to grow this career into one I can look back on with pride, and enjoy every step of the way.</p>
